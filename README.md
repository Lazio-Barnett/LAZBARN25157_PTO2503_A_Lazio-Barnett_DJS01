# DJS01: Vanilla JS Podcast App

## Overview

This project is a responsive web application that allows users to **browse podcast shows** on a landing page and **view detailed information** in a modal. The application displays clear, concise previews of podcast shows and offers additional information through a modal pop-up, **all without navigating away from the page**. The app showcases clean code architecture and strong UI/UX design while following JavaScript best practices.

## Core Objectives

### 1. Landing Page – Podcast Previews

- Display a list of podcast shows on the landing page.
- Each podcast preview includes:
  - Cover image
  - Show title
  - Number of seasons

### 2. Modal View – Show Details

- When a user clicks on a podcast preview, a modal opens.
- The modal includes:
  - Larger cover image
  - Podcast title
  - Description of the show
  - Genre tags
  - Last updated date (readable format)
  - List of season titles
  - Number of episodes in each season
- A clear and accessible way to **close the modal**.

### 3. Code Architecture & Best Practices

- Utilizes **object-oriented programming (OOP)** where appropriate.
- Applies **functional programming principles** for modularity and predictability.
- Follows **SOLID design principles** for clean, maintainable code.
- Abstracts repeated logic into **reusable functions or classes**.
- Includes **JSDoc comments** for major functions and modules.

## Technical Requirements

- Built with **HTML, CSS (or Tailwind), and JavaScript**.
- No page reloads: JavaScript handles modal behavior and data rendering.
- Smooth UI states (modal open/close, hover effects, etc.).
- Data displayed in a **readable and accessible format**.

## Design & UX Goals

- Visually appealing UI with clear layout and hierarchy.
- Consistent **color scheme, typography, spacing, and sizing**.
